# ISSumSet: A Tweet Summarization Dataset Hidden in a TREC Track

This GitHub repository contains the code we used to transform the 2018-2019 TREC Incident Streams dataset into a tweet summarization dataset. You can find more information in the paper: "ISSumSet: A Tweet Summarization Dataset Hidden in a TREC Track".

## Parts of this repository

* [Model evaluation](./Model%20evaluation): Evaluate your own model
* [Paper annotations](./Paper%20annotations): Annotations (subevents, redundancy and coverage) 
* [Reproduce results](./Reproduce%20results): Reproduce results we reported in the paper, more detailed information about the analyses and examples
* [Sets](./Sets): Repository for sets/summaries (inluding **NHP** and **NHPAR** gold standards)
* [TREC IS annotations](./TREC%20IS%20annotations): TREC IS annotations
* [Tweets](./Tweets): Raw tweets

## Package Requirements

Python 3.7

```
easy-rouge==0.2.2
gensim==3.7.2
matplotlib==3.0.2
nltk==3.5
numpy==1.17.2
pandas==0.23.4
py-readability-metrics==1.4.3
scikit-learn==0.22.2.post1
scipy==1.2.1
seaborn==0.9.0
tqdm==4.28.1
```

* Run each python file in the directory of the file.

## Data Requirements

Download tweets and annotations on the TREC IS website :
* [Annotations](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~richardm/TREC_IS/2020/2020A/TRECIS_2018_2019-labels.json "TREC IS Annotations 2018-2019")
* [Tweets](http://dcs.gla.ac.uk/~richardm/TREC_IS/2020/data.html "TREC IS Tweets 2018-2019"): Follow the instructions and download **trecis2018-test**, **trecis2018-train**, **trecis2019-A-test** and **trecis2019-B-test** sets

* Put the annotations json file in the [TREC IS annotations](./TREC%20IS%20annotations) directory (See Section 3.2.1 of the paper)
* Put the tweets json files (unzip the IS files) in the [Tweets](./Tweets) directory (See Section 3.2.2 of the paper)

## First/Mandatory step

Run the python file :

```
python initialization.py [-remove_coverage=False]
```

* Summaries **NHP** and **NHPAR** will be generated and put into [Sets](./Sets) directory, see this [README](./Sets/README.md) for more details. (Section 5.3 of the paper)
* Using the option *-remove_coverage=True* you can genereate the **NHPAR** summaries without the coverage annotations. (Section 4.2.2 of the paper)

## Reproduce paper results

Once the initialization.py file has been run you can reproduce the results of the paper. To do so, see this [README.md](./Reproduce%20results/README.md) file.

## Evaluate your own model

You can compare your own model, see this [README](./Model%20evaluation/README.md) fore more details.

## Example
